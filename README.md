# Super Mario Brothers - Mouse Tracking
A demo where Mario and Luigi follow your mouse (or finger) across the screen. I used an SVG to manipulate there eyes on the `mousemove` and `touchmove` event listeners and make them blink every few seconds. You can also hit them on the nose for a little extra animation! To further enhance it all I used a custom Mario glove cursor with hover effect and a custom Super Mario Font with individual letter animations.
